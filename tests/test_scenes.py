"""Scenes 1 to 7 of the arc, scripted on the report application against the OTO release this
plugin pins: the project (scene 1), a capture of the report product's obligations through the
gates and the questions the graph then answers (scene 2), what scene 3 derives from (the
specification as facts), the design captured against `ddd` and traced to the specification and
the flow captured against `flow` (scene 4), the implementing agent's brief: BLOCKED by name
until the missing fact is captured, then READY (scene 5), the site rendered from the graph, the
domain pack on a marketplace and the product's store and site published (scene 6), and two
readers: one installs the pack and asks, one syncs the store and asks (scene 7). Needs the engine importable (`OTO_HOME`, or `oto-kg` installed)
and the `product` and `product-report` packs on the machine (`oto ontology list`)."""
